            <p>Hi There! Welcome to my Code the Dream Todo App for the React Course!</p>
            <p>I'm a huge fan of anything early 2000s, so I styled this app to hopefully offer a similar vibe. 
                I mainly got inspiration from other sites hosted on Neocities.
            </p>

            <p>Feel free to play around with the app by adding some todos (ofc with your own api keys).</p>

            <p>I hope to make this app a bit more stylish in the future, but so far I have been enjoying this course!</p>
